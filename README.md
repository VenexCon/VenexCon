<h2> Projects & Prototypes </h2> 

<a target="_blank" href = "https://www.primebarber.co.uk/"><h3>PRIME Barbers Website</h3></a>
<p>This website was created for a local barbershop that did not currently have one. This is a work in progress but the styling and content is 95% of the way there. I approached the local barber and asked if he would be interested in having a website that would showcase his business with a sleek and modern design. This website was created from a basic template, where the whole website is built within media queries, with the site becoming responsive, dependant upon the size of the desktop (vw). </p>
<p>This was made using VS code, and Koala for the LESS compilation. The initial color scheme and pictures were chosen with the client, with regular updates on website progress along with requests for client input where required. No detailed design was put foward, so a sample of other sites were chosen prior to work beginning on the design of the site.</p>

<h3><a href = "https://bright-custard-4973e6.netlify.app/">Github Finder</a></h3>

<p> This was my first foray into React.js and it was as part of Traversy Medias React Front-To-Back 2022 React course. This app utilise useState, useContext, and reducer functions to search Github and display users information and repos. This project although simple did help expose me to alot of React's features and aided in becoming familiar with functional components and how React manipulates the DOM object. I did supplement these learnings by checking out the React docs, and other online resources to gain a deeper knowledge of React hooks and props. I am concious of becoming stuck in tutorial hell, so I have decided to recreate the Weather Hazard App utilising React. <p>

<a href ="https://github.com/VenexCon/Project-Etch-a-Sketch"><h3> Etch-a-Sketch Project </h3> </a>

<p> This project was to create a live recreation of the kids game Etch-a-Sketch, obviously wiht some limitations. This project tested DOM manioulation to a higher degree as well as using nodelists and the command of CSS:Grid and Flex. This game did stump me on a few occasions but has since proved invalubale in cemetning the use of loops, functions, clalbacks and ES6 syntax. I did struggle to ensure the grid was responsivle, and had trouble with container blow-out, but this was all fixed with the help of css-tricks.com and MDN docs. There is still one outstanding task i have on this project but it functions well and meets the requirements of the design.
 
The adiditional extra also includes a random generator for an item for the person to paint.

<h4> link to live version https://venexcon.github.io/Libary-/</h4> 

<p> This project was intended to showcase the use of constructors, 
    DOM manipulation and limited array functions. I emphasised good commits
     and ensuring good commentary of the code throughout</p>

<p>This code went through multiple refactors in relation to the main script.JS, and although it works much better than the first iteration, there are improvements to be made. </p>
<p>No local storage was used, in the project</p>
