<h2> Projects & Prototypes </h2> 

<a href ="https://github.com/VenexCon/Rock-Paper-Scissors"><h3> Rock, Paper, Scissors </h3> </a> 

<p> This project was to have the player select an option and play a game of rock, apper, scissors against a randomly generated computer option. This originally started as a console game, and then subsequntly became interactive through dom manipulation. The oriignal selectors were buttons, but changed to image based divs' using CSS effects to create a more responsive feel. There is a readMe within the project file and a list of further additions. </p>

<p> This was one of my very first projects utilising DOM manipulation. I also found that game design is an area that I am glad to have been exposed too, but not something I am hugely passionate about </p>

<a href ="https://github.com/VenexCon/Project-Etch-a-Sketch"><h3> Etch-a-Sketch Project </h3> </a>

<p> This project was to create a live recreation of the kids game Etch-a-Sketch, obviously wiht some limitations. This project tested DOM manioulation to a higher degree as well as using nodelists and the command of CSS:Grid and Flex. This game did stump me on a few occasions but has since proved invalubale in cemetning the use of loops, functions, clalbacks and ES6 syntax. I did struggle to ensure the grid was responsivle, and had trouble with container blow-out, but this was all fixed with the help of css-tricks.com and MDN docs. There is still one outstanding task i have on this project but it functions well and meets the requirements of the design.
 
The adiditional extra also includes a random generator for an item for the person to paint.

<h3>Libary Project</h3> 
<h4> link to live version https://venexcon.github.io/Libary-/</h4> 

<p> This project was intended to showcase the use of constructors, 
    DOM manipulation and limited array functions. I emphasised good commits
     and ensuring good commentary of the code throughout</p>

<p>This code went through multiple refactors in relation to the main script.JS, and although it works much better than the first iteration, there are improvements to be made. </p>
<p>No local storage was used, in the project</p>
